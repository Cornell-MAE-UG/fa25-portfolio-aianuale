Hello! My name is Ava Ianuale, I am an undergraduate senior in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University minoring in Materials Science, graduating in Spring 2026. My academic and professional interests lie in building air and spacecraft that enable discovery and bring about technological advancements and services to humanity.

I will be concurrently enrolled in an accelerated Master of Engineering degree at Cornell in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in spacecraft engineering during my last undergraduate semester, aiming to graduate with an M.Eng. in Fall 2026.
