## Introduction

In October 2018, domestic passenger Lion Air Flight 610 departed from Soekharno-Hatta International Airport carrying 181 passengers and 8 crew members, bound for Depati Amir Airport. 13 minutes after takeoff, it crashed into the Java Sea off the northern coast of the Indonesian island of Java, killing all 189 people onboard. The aircraft was a Boeing 737 MAX, a recently developed passenger plane whose entry into service happened a year or two prior in May 2017. The 737 MAX is widely understood to be Boeing's response to the launch of Airbus' A320neo, a direct competitor of Boeing's 737 line that offered superior fuel efficiency to then-current 737NG variant. In March 2019, five months after the Lion Air catastrophe, the Boeing 737 MAX used for Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed into the city of Bishoftu just six minutes after takeoff. The crash claimed 346 lives, including those of all 157 people onboard the flight. Following this second incident, air authorities across the world grounded the 737 MAX. During the grounding period, Boeing redesigned the systems of concern and the MAX reentered service 20 months later. Despite reputational damage, the Boeing 737 MAX still flies today and has been largely successful and competitive in the market.

The culprit system in both fatal crashes was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, commonly referred as MCAS. In the interest of expediting the 737 MAX under pressure from the success of the A320neo, Boeing decided to retrofit the existing 737 fuselage with new engines instead of designing an entirely new vehicle. The new, more fuel-efficient engines were heavier and were mounted further back on the fuselage, relocating the center of mass and causing changes in plane dynamics and handling. MCAS was Boeing's solution to these changes. The MCAS software was intended to prevent stall by automating aircraft pitch corrections that pushed the nose of the plane down at high angle of attack (AOA), a condition made more likely due to the mass redistribution. In both crashes, this software repeatedly activated erroneously, collapsing stable flight and forcing the aircraft to plummet down to the ground. 

Investigations following these disasters have revealed information that raises questions about the decisions of multiple parties at varying levels of administration that ultimately led to the deaths of 535 people and dealt massive reputational damage to Boeing and the engineering/aviation professions. The following report identifies and analyzes some of the main ethical questions pertaining to the design, certification, and integration of the 737 MAX as it relates to these two MCAS-driven crashes. It aims to offer greater insight into how accidents of this magnitude were allowed to happen, provide an in-depth ethical analysis of engineering and management decisions in the context of generally accepted ethical principles and codes, and ultimately propose prevention strategies to preempt similar occurrences.


## Delegation of Certification Authority to Boeing

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) delegated a substantial amount of the 737 MAX certification process to Boeing under the Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program. This redistribution of certification power included the MCAS system. Boeing performed its own risk analyses, where they classified unintended MCAS activation as a “major” failure, one grade less severe than “catastrophic” failure. They also presented MCAS as a limited modification to an existing system, downplaying the power of the software.

Given the FAA’s large regulatory workload, redelegating certification responsibilities was an efficient way to meet regulatory demands. Certification redelegation to companies is not uncommon in aviation, and has been used in the past with few consequences. The FAA also likely trusted Boeing’s long-standing reputation as a reliable aircraft manufacturer. However, the financial incentives and competitive pressure from Airbus’s A320neo likely increased the risk of conflicts of interest within delegated certification roles. 

*To what extent should the FAA have delegated the responsibility of certifying plane safety systems to Boeing, given the tendency for employees of any company to exhibit company loyalty over public safety?*

Using the ASME Code of Ethics, this question primarily implcates Canon 1 (hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public), Canon 4 (act as faithful agents or trustees), and Canon 7 (issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner). In this scenario, Canon 4 is in conflict with Canon 1, as the best decisions for the public and the company may differ. It is in Boeing's and the FAA's interests to redelegate and expedite certification, but it is in the public's interest to avoid the release of unsafe planes arising from potential conflicts of interest. In accordance with the Fundamental Principles of the code, which prioritizes public good over personal gain, public safety is more important than company interests. By delegating certification power to Boeing, the FAA violated Canon 1 and allowed Boeing to certify its own system under conditions of clear conflict of interest. Suggested prevention methods include baseline FAA authority over all safety-critical systems, independent third-party review of flight control software, and stronger conflict-of-interest trainings within Boeing.

## Engineers Speaking Up Versus Deferring to Leadership

MCAS was designed to trigger based on a single AOA sensor reading, despite the existence of two AOA sensors on the plane. Engineers as a general population are aware of the importance of redundancy, especially in life-critical situations. Integrating the second AOA sensor would've been slightly more involved, but realistically, the amount of time and effort to design MCAS to trigger based on two sensors should not be significant relative to the multi-year timeline of whole-plane development. In a survey of Boeing employees, 40% of respondents felt "undue pressure" to conform to management priorities at some point during their time at the company. These conditions likely discouraged engineers from speaking up about safety concerns.

We can assume that Boeing engineers understood the risks of single-sensor dependency and the importance of redundancy in safety-critical systems. However, organizational pressure from leadership likely prevented engineers from speaking out. Engineers may also have believed higher-level reviews would catch unsafe designs, leading them to be more lax in their initial designs.

*Should Boeing engineers have spoken up about concerns regarding single sensor dependency and poor reliability, refusing to follow through with the design without ensuring more reliable performance?* 

This question engages Canon 1 (public safety), Canon 2 (perform services only in areas of competence), Canon 4 (loyalty to employer), and Canon 10 (hold peers and employers accountable). Canon 4 directly conflicts with Canons 1 and 10 when company loyalty suppresses safety concerns. Engineers have an ethical obligation to refuse participation in designs they reasonably believe to be unsafe. In this case, deferring to leadership allowed a flawed system to enter service, violating Canons 1, 2, and 7. Canon 1 again remains the most important. Potential improvements include reinforcing engineers’ authority to halt certification on safety grounds, rewarding and not penalizing design conservatism, and strengthening internal whistleblower protections to reduce fear of retaliation.

## Transparency to Pilots About MCAS

Boeing deliberately omitted references to MCAS from pilot manuals and training differences tables to minimize retraining requirements. Mark Forkner, a main driver of the pilot training reduction, was ultimately rewarded by Boeing for his work in removing the need for additional MCAS-specific training. Pilots were unaware of the existence of MCAS at all, let alone the specifics of the behavior it actuated. Also, the FAA approved MCAS before Boeing expanded MCAS capabilities in as indicated in a later documentation revision, a change not clearly communicated to regulators or pilots. As a result, the final range of MCAS in the delivered planes greatly exceeded what the planes were believed to be certified for---to some extent, transparency was lost to the regulators and not just the pilots.

Boeing's belief that the frequency with which MCAS would unexpectedly activate, combined with their expectation that pilots would respond appropriately to any anomalies, are their main explanations for nondisclosure. It is worth noting that MCAS did erroneously activate during test flights of the 737MAX, and Boeing was aware that accidental triggering of the system was a concern to a certain extent. However, competitive pressure and cost concerns surrounding pilot training further motivated nondisclosure. Engineers and management alike likely understood that erroneous MCAS activation could produce critical scenarios, and still chose not to disclose any information about MCAS to pilots. Additionally, in the aftermath of the accidents, Boeing failed to take responsibility for the crashes, insisting that the pilots should be able to respond to a wide range of scenarios, including the unexpected activation of MCAS regardless of their awareness of the root cause of the issue. 

*Should Boeing engineers have informed pilots of the MCAS system, even it it was designed to act autonomously with no pilot action required?*

Canon 1 (public safety), Canon 7 (truthful public statements), and Canon 10 (disclosure of safety violations) apply. These Canons conflict with Canon 4, but remain the most important when considering public impact. Had pilots been aware of MCAS, they could've acted in a more informed manner during emergencies. Transparency is not optional in safety-critical systems. Suggested improvements include mandatory disclosure of all automated flight control systems, pilot involvement in design reviews, and FAA regulations defining minimum disclosure and training requirements for new automation.

## Simplicity Versus Redundancy in Engineering Design

As stated above, MCAS relied on a single AOA sensor, despite Boeing acknowledging that sensor failure was possible. Including input from another AOA sensor---adding redundancy---would've lowered the rate of accidental MCAS activation. Boeing was able to skirt around redundancy requirements by classifying unintended MCAS activation as a “major” rather than “catastrophic” failure, a decision that aged rather poorly with the Lion Air and Ethiopian Air crashes.  

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Boeing engineers understood that redundancy is a fundamental safety principle. Even in "major" failure scenarios, redundancy is a valuable design feature that should be sought even when policies don't explicitly require it. Simplicity is also a valuable design feature, but not when it undermines safety. Boeing, constrained by time pressure, cost considerations, and certification thresholds, likely pursued simpler designs to expedite approval at the expense of redundancy.

*Should engineers have designed for input from one of multiple sensors, in the context of simplicity vs redundancy as an engineering design choice?*

Canon 1 (safety), Canon 2 (competence), and Canon 4 (company interest) apply. Prioritizing simplicity and cost over redundancy disregard both safety and professional competence, violating Canons 1 and 2. In the same pattern as the previously mentioned ethical situations, company loyalty is at odds with the other considerations, and the same conclusion of public vs private interest applies. Single-point failures are ethically indefensible in safety-critical aviation systems. Engineers must prioritize redundancy even when failures are statistically “remote”, especially when that probalility termination is victim to conflicts of interest. Suggested improvement strategies include FAA-mandated redundancy standards for flight control systems, multi-stakeholder design reviews, and industry-wide commitments to conservative safety margins irrespective of market pressure.

## Whistleblower Protections

As indicated above, 40% of Boeing employee survey respondents at some point experienced pressure to conform within Boeing. Boeing has a history of rewarding employees that act in their interest, such was the case with Mark Forkner. There is limited evidence of robust internal whistleblower protections during the 737 MAX development, and there may not have been enough perceived protection guaranteed by state or federal legislation for engineers and other Boeing employees to feel safe in calling out the flawed design. Engineers were likely discouraged from escalating concerns due to job security fears and organizational norms, and existing legal protections may have been unclear or insufficiently enforced.

*Should companies and the government support and enforce whistleblower protections, in the context of providing legal protections and job security to employees who speak out against unsafe design decisions?*

Canon 9 (seek sanction against violations), Canon 10 (accountability), and Canon 1 (public safety) conflict with Canon 4 when whistleblowing threatens corporate interests. Whistleblower protections are essential for enabling ethical action under organizational pressure. Governments and companies must provide clear legal protections, anonymous reporting channels, and job security guarantees. Without such safeguards, engineers cannot realistically fulfill their ethical duties as dictated by generally accepted engineering code.

## Discussion

The Boeing 737 MAX crashes were a result of many failures on the individual, company, and industry level. Competitive pressure created an environment of hasty design decisions, suppressed dissent, lack of transparency, and insufficient regulatory oversight, all of which resulted in a flawed final aircraft that put public health and safety at risk. In order to uphold public safety, as well as the public opinion of and trust in the engineering profession, engineers and engineering companies should be held ethically responsible to the standards touched on in this report. Conflicting personal, corporate, and ethical interests will be present in all engineering applications, and engineers must understand that it is their duty to bring about positive change and hold the health and safety of the general public above all.
